        The only reliable way to detect hypertension is through a blood pressure measurement by a
        healthcare professional. While self-monitoring with automated devices can be convenient, a
        professional evaluation is crucial to assess your risk and any related conditions. That's
        why we've created an AI powered risk analyzer that uses insights from your daily life to
        help you understand your risk of hypertension quickly, easily, and accurately.

          What is hypertension?
        <p>
        <p>
          High blood pressure is a common condition that affects the body's arteries. It's also
          called hypertension. If you have high blood pressure, the force of the blood pushing
          against the artery walls is consistently too high. The heart has to work harder to pump
          blood.
          <br />
          <br />
          Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). In general, hypertension is
          a blood pressure reading of 130/80 mm Hg or higher.
          <br />
          <br />
          Hypertension is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including stroke, heart
          attack, heart failure, and aneurysm. Managing blood pressure is vital for preserving
          health and reducing the risk of these dangerous conditions.
